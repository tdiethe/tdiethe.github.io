<!-- Tom Diethe was born in London, UK, in 1977. He received a B.Sc. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Bristol in 2000, then taking up an industrial research position at QinetiQ, where in 2004 he received the Future Systems Technology division “Star Award” for outstanding achievement. In 2005 he received an M.Sc. with distinction and best project award in Intelligent Systems, and then in 2010 received a Ph.D. in machine learning applied to multivariate signal processing, both from University College London. After two post-doctoral positions in the departments of Computer Science and Statistical Science at UCL, he has since worked for the British Medical Journal and Microsoft Research Cambridge, before taking up a position as a Research Fellow for the SPHERE IRC at the Department of Electrical Engineering of the University of Bristol. His current research interests include probabilistic machine learning, computational statistics, learning theory, and data fusion. -->

Dr Tom Diethe is currently an Applied Science Manager in Amazon Research, Seattle, USA. 

* Lead for machine learning on the intersection of the life sciences - genomics, proteomics, computational biology
* Previous teams (Cambridge, UK):
  * Alexa Shopping: Privacy preserving machine learning (differential privacy)
  * Supply Chain Optimization Technologies: uncertainty quantification, Gaussian processes for forecasting, probabilistic methods, anomaly detection, outlier detection, time series analysis, clustering
  * Core machine learning: continual learning, streaming machine learning, online learning

Tom is also an Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Bristol.

Tom was formerly a Research Fellow for the £15 million [SPHERE](http://www.irc-sphere.ac.uk) Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) at the University of Bristol, which is designing a platform for eHealth in a smart-home context. This platform is currently being deployed into homes throughout Bristol. You may have seen the [SPHERE House](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/technology-topics/smart-technology/the-sphere-house-can-monitor-its-residents-health) featured on the BBC's 'Joy of Data' documentary or in the wonderful [Aardman animated overview of the project](http://www.aardman.com/work/sphere-project/).

Our video accompanying the paper “Releasing eHealth Analytics into the Wild: Lessons Learnt from the SPHERE Project” is up on the KDD YouTube channel:

Tom specialises in probabilistic and deep learning methods for machine learning applications in the life sciences, including data fusion, online/sequence/time-series modelling, unsupervised/active/transfer/self-supervised learning approaches. He has a Ph.D. in Machine Learning applied to multivariate signal processing from UCL, and was employed by Microsoft Research Cambridge where he co-authored a book titled "Model-Based Machine Learning", an early access online version of which is available at <http://www.mbmlbook.com>. He also has significant industrial experience, with positions at QinetiQ and the British Medical Journal, during which time he has performed application-driven research, and has pioneered large-scale production-ready software engineering projects. He is a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society and a member of the IEEE Signal Processing Society. Contact him at <tom.diethe@bristol.ac.uk>
